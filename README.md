# Virtual Bookshelf

It's a Web Application running just as Front End (localStorage). The idea of the application is to give the user a virtual bookshelf, where the user could add, edit and remove books and also comment on books.

### Used technologies

- React (create-react-app)
- Redux
- Redux Thunk
- React Router

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```
node v12.15.0 (npm)
```

### Installing

1. clone the git repository: `git clone`
2. navigate to the project's folder with `cd foldername`
3. run `npm install`
4. after all the dependencies are installed run `npm run`
5. run it accessing: `http://localhost:3000`

## Tests

### Notes

Here I have just writted some "smoke tests" to show the concept and that tests are important and should be implemented. In a real world application (with production goal) I would do more on unit testings and a E2E test.

### Instructions

1. run `npm test`.
